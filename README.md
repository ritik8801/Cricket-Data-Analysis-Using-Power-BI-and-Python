# Data Analytics on Cricket Dataset Using PowerBI and Python

1) Analyzed data from over 50 T20 matches played during the 2022 world cup, using various statistical and machine learning techniques, to identify the most effective players and build a dream team.

2) Utilized the BrightData library to extract data from the espncricinfo website, including match scores, player statistics, and other relevant information.
3) Implemented data cleaning and transformation procedures using Python and its Pandas library, and used Jupyter Notebook as the development environment.
4) Created a Power BI dashboard that allows users to explore and visualize the data in various ways, including through interactive charts and graphs.
5) Used Power Query within Power BI to perform additional data transformations, and utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expression) to build parameters and measures for the dashboard.
